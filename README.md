Welcome to Never Ending Stickies
=================

- Click `Add Sticky` button to add a sticky.
- Drag them around by clicking or tapping on the note header.
- Double click (doesn't work on phones yet) on the note header to "drill down" into another board.
- There's breadcrumbs to allow you to navigate "back up" the boards.
- You can find text in a sticky but only the ones on the current board.


The Project
------------

On the front-end,
- `examples` folder has, well, runnable examples via `npm test`
- Implemented the MVC pattern in the client side, checkout `lib/MakeKeyValueObservable.js`

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
